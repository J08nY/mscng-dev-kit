Installing a new hash algorithm

With the changes in the cryptography API in Microsoft Windows Vista, it is possible for users to plug in their own algorithms in the cryptography API framework.
This SDK includes samples which show how to install a new hash algorithm.

To plug in a new hash algorithm, the users need to do the following:

1. Create a DLL for the new hash provider and register it. 
   For this step, please refer to the hash provider sample.
2. Register the object identifiers for the new hash algorithms
   For this step, please refer to the register OIDs sample. 
3. Use the new hash algorithm for a crypto functionality such as signing a certificate.
   For this step, please refer to the Plugging new hash algorithms sample.

Each of these 3 steps are in separate samples. 

Please refer to the README files of each of the individual samples to learn more.
